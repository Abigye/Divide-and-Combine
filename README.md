🧩 Merge Sort Visualizer
A visual, interactive tool built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS to help learners understand how the Merge Sort algorithm works through multiple modes of visualization.

🚀 Features
This project includes three different Merge Sort visualizers:

Merge Sort – Try It Yourself
Step through the algorithm manually by choosing when to "Split" or "Merge" subarrays. Get instant feedback as you interact.

Merge Sort – Current Step View
Automatically shows one step at a time in the merge sort process with a reference to the previous step. Great for focusing on each transformation clearly.

Merge Sort – Full Depth View
Displays the complete breakdown and reassembly of the array during merge sort, offering a full-picture understanding.

🛠️ Tech Stack
⚡ Vite – Fast and modern frontend tooling

⚛️ React – UI framework for building components

🎨 Tailwind CSS – Utility-first styling for rapid design
