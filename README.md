# 🧩 Merge Sort Visualizer

A visual, interactive tool built with **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** to help learners understand how the Merge Sort algorithm works through multiple modes of visualization.

## 🚀 Features

This project includes three different Merge Sort visualizers:

### 🔹 Merge Sort – Try It Yourself  
Step through the algorithm manually by choosing when to **"Split"** or **"Merge"** subarrays. Get instant feedback as you interact.

### 🔹 Merge Sort – Current Step View  
Automatically shows one step at a time in the merge sort process with a reference to the previous step. Great for focusing on each transformation clearly.

### 🔹 Merge Sort – Full Depth View  
Displays the complete breakdown and reassembly of the array during merge sort, offering a full-picture understanding.
